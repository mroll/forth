# Forth Hacks

## General

I would like to use this repository to store code I write while exploring the Forth language. I am using the GNU Forth interpreter (gforth) on Mac OSX Yosemite. Installation is probably easiest through homebrew: `brew install gforth`.

Forth files can be loaded and executed with `gforth <file> -e bye`. The 'bye' at the end simply exits the interpreter when the code is finished running.
